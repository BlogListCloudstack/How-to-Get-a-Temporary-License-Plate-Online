            </p>
            <p>
                In these instances, a temporary license plate (AZ) can help to ensure you are safe and legal while driving. Read on to find out more about when you might need one and how to get one.

            <h2>What Are Temporary License Plates For?</h2>
            <p>
                Regardless of if new or used, all cars in the United States require a registered license plate before they are legally allowed on the road. But there are instances when that’s not as simple as it seems. That’s where Arizona’s temporary license plates come in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coming in the form of a piece of paper that should be presented where it can be easily seen (for instance, on the dashboard), the temporary license plate allows you to drive legally when – for whatever reason – you might not have access to the real ones. The best place to keep it is in the car as it is a requirement to have it on you at all times while driving.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, when might you need one? Here are the main reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>When moving from one state to another</li>
                <li>When importing a vehicle from another country</li>
                <li>When taking the car to an inspection</li>
                <li>When you have the vehicle’s title but not the plates</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The most important thing to know is that it is illegal to drive without a license plate, so should you find yourself without one in Arizona, be sure to get hold of a temporary one.
            </p>

            <h2>How To Get a Temporary Arizona License Plate Online</h2>
            <p>
                While it might seem like a hassle, ensuring you have the required temporary license plate will mean you are following the law and protecting yourself. But how do you get hold of one? The easiest way to do it is online by following <a href="https://itstillruns.com/do-temporary-tag-az-8566547.html">these steps</a>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Step 1:</b> Find an online service such as Service Arizona and find the restricted use permit section – often found in the ‘Most Popular Services’ list.</li>
                <li><b>Step 2:</b> Choose the length of the temporary license plate you need. You’ll be required to print a sample paper to ensure your printer is set up correctly, so follow those instructions before clicking on ‘Continue’.</li>
                <li><b>Step 3:</b> Here you will need to add in the vehicle identification number (VIN) as well as the driver’s license number.</li>
                <li><b>Step 4:</b> Next is the payment stage. You’ll need the driver’s name, address, card number, and the card’s expiration date. You’ll be presented with a confirmation page which you can continue through.</li>
                <li><b>Step 5:</b> Once payment has been taken, you will be presented with the chance to print the permit (including how many copies you will need). As soon as you have the permit and temporary registration printed, you can use them in your car, and rest assured you are driving legally.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Long are Temporary Plates Good For?</h2>
            <p>
                When it comes to the length of the temporary car license plate, there are <a href="https://www.ggandd.com/arizona-mvd-services/temporary-permit/">several options</a>. The one you choose will depend on what you require it for. Furthermore, each option has rules attached as to who can use it and what it can be used for.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The first option is a three day permit. This is perfect if the car needs to be transported from one location to another quickly, and there are no further plans for the car once it has arrived at its destination.</li>
                <li>Next is a 30-day option. This is for general use, but can only be issued once in a 12 month period. A major benefit here is that there are no movement restrictions or residency requirements.</li>
                <li>Finally, is a 90-day registration permit. Reserved for Arizona residents only, this permit is ideal for those who do not yet have a complete vehicle registration.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Figuring out which one suits you best will ensure you get the most for your money, as well as keeping you safe in the knowledge you are complying with the law at all times. If in any doubt, don’t hesitate to contact a motor vehicle service company or drop into a store where staff will always be happy to help.

            <h2>Are Temporary Plates in Arizona Expensive?</h2>
            <p>
                The price of a temporary license plate can vary across states. Some (like Arizona) offer a flat rate, while others use the weight, date, or value of the car to determine the price. Either way, the fees are <a href="https://getjerry.com/driving/how-to-get-a-temporary-license-plate-in-arizona#how-to-find-affordable-car-insurance-in-arizona">quite reasonable</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting with a $1 fee for a three-day permit and maxing out at $15 for both the 30 and 90-day permits, it won’t set you back too much. If ever you are unsure, the National Conference of State Legislatures holds all the information you need!
